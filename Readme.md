## Pluginable
Universal Python Framework.

Pluginable helps to create modular applications with setup + loop structure common in microcomputer and GUI programming.

### Latest stable
[Release v0.3](https://github.com/Jakub21/Pluginable/releases/tag/v0.3)

- init+loop approach
- utilizes multiprocessing (each plugin runs in separate process)
- supports events system (plugins can communicate with each other this way)
- unified plugins i/o (allows automated GUIs and possibly eases integration of AI)

### Framework applications
This framework was tested with the following packages: PyGame, TkInter, socket.

### Usage

#### Installation
Pluginable is an installable package but was not released to PIP. Navigate to root of this repo and execute `sudo python3 setup.py install`

#### Creating Pluginable apps
I will write on how to create apps in this framework in separate file. It will be linked here when it is ready.
